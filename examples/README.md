# Examples

## From [`edemaine`](https://github.com/edemaine/reveal-pug-talk/discussions/4)

Here is a list of open-source presentations I've made based on (slight variations of) this template:

- [Yin-Yang Puzzles are NP-complete](https://github.com/edemaine/talk-yin-yang)
illustrates inline [SVG Tiler](https://github.com/edemaine/svgtiler) figure drawing + JavaScript puzzle embedding
- [Token Swapping on Trees](https://github.com/edemaine/talk-token-swapping-in-trees)
illustrates `SVG.js` animations via special Reveal `.fragments`. (This first talk is what inspired the template.)
